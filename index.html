          SUSI, one of the project that caught my eyes from FOSSASIA that I really loved working on is best open source AI which is still in early stages making huge progress.

          One of the reasons why I love SUSI is active community. They have got the apps created for SUSI across almost all platforms. A cross platform desktop app (still in active development), an <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.fossasia.susi.ai">Android app</a>, and even a <a href="https://asksusi.com">web app</a>.

          Recently, I got my hands on the Android app of SUSI, and I must say that the progress that they have made is amazing. Last time when I used the app, it was really buggy. But as of now, I must say it is reaching the stage where it is allowed to be used by common people and not just developers and testers.

          No matter if this competition ends, if I will be winner or not, but as I have loved this app so much. I will definitely be one of the most active contributors to this project.
